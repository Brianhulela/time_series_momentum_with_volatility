# 12-Month Time-Series Momentum Strategy

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook exploring a 12-month time-series momentum strategy applied to US equities.  

The notebook demonstrates how to:

- Calculate long-term momentum signals  
- Apply volatility targeting to control risk  
- Compare strategy performance against a buy and hold benchmark  
- Visualize cumulative returns, buy/sell signals, and drawdowns  

The project is intended as a research and educational resource for understanding long-term trend-following techniques.
